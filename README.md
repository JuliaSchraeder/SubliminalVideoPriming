##  Abstract

*Aim:* Investigating the neural, behavioral, and speech markers of mood-congruent bias in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and its relationship with cognitive control deficits.

*Method:* Participants (n = 126; 60 MDD, 66 controls) underwent an fMRI video task with subliminally presented happy/sad facial expressions (16.7 ms) that were either congruent or incongruent with video emotion content. Additionally, participants completed storytelling tasks (positive/negative events) with speech recordings and psychological assessments outside the scanner.

*Results:* Participants detected emotions more accurately and quickly when videos and subliminal primes were congruent. MDD patients performed worse overall, especially when happy videos were paired with sad primes. fMRI revealed increased activation in right inferior and middle occipital and temporal gyri in MDD. Speech–psychological interactions did not significantly differ by group.

*Conclusion:* Neuroimaging suggests compensatory mechanisms in MDD through increased cognitive effort in emotional processing. Through this multimodal approach, the study highlights intertwined emotional and cognitive dynamics that may perpetuate mood-congruent biases and depression severity.
